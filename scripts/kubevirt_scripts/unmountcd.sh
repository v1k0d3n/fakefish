#### This script has to unmount the iso from the server's virtualmedia and return 0 if operation succeeded, 1 otherwise
#### You will get the following vars as environment vars
#### BMC_ENDPOINT - Has the BMC IP
#### BMC_USERNAME - Has the username configured in the BMH/InstallConfig and that is used to access BMC_ENDPOINT
#### BMC_PASSWORD - Has the password configured in the BMH/InstallConfig and that is used to access BMC_ENDPOINT
